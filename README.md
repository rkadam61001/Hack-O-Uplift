###  Project Theme: Education
<h1>Problem Statement:</h1>
To create a application for teacher so that they can upload the tests mainly quizes on moodle smoothly.

### Description:
Mostly all colleges are using moodle to conduct online quizes and conduct academic exams on it.But what we came to know that it takes hours to create tests(probably quiz) for students because the moodle accepts only aiken format which is cumbersome.
### What is Aiken Format?
The Aiken format is a very simple way of creating multiple choice questions using a clear human-readable format in a text file. The question must be all on one line. Each answer must start with a single uppercase letter, followed by a period '.' or a bracket ')', then a space. The answer line must immediately follow, starting with "ANSWER: " (NOTE the space after the colon) and then giving the appropriate letter.So basically,Aiken format has a lot more restriction adding further it also expects user to save file in text format and it also asks the user to write the answer letters (A,B,C etc.) and the word "ANSWER" must be capitalised as shown below, otherwise the import will fail.<br>
What is the correct answer to this question?<br>
 A. Is it this one?<br>
 B. Maybe this answer?<br>
C. Possibly this one?<br>
D. Must be this one!<br>
ANSWER: D<br>
### What problem does our application solve?
 Our application takes care of each and every aspects that are required for aiken format.Only the user have to simply enter question ,options and the answer.And the whole formatting will be done by the application itself.
